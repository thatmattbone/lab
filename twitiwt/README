This is my early attempt to create a twitter bot
for detecting palindromes.  Right now it's just my
vehicle for playing around with event-oriented programming
in Python.  Please don't use it for some stupid fucking
social media nonsense your boss cooked up.

To run things you'll need a twitter account.
Create a passwords.py file with two globals, for example:

TWITTER_USERNAME = 'SARAHPalinUSA'
TWITTER_PASSWORD = 'din0saurZrFake'
